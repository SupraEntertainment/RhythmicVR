# VRRythmGame

The following list contains my plans for this Project:
- [ ] Modularity / support for multiple gamemodes (addable afterwards -> via assetbundles?)
	- [ ] Beat Saber inspired gamemode (Hands, feet, hips / Swords) with support for feet / hip tracker
	- [ ] DDR inspired gamemode (arrow pad on floor)
	- [ ] Audica inspired gamemode (with Guns)
	- [ ] kind of Guitar hero on the floor (for feet)

### Mechanics
- Song loading via json file (json specs in code -> Song.cs & Beatmap.cs)
- dynamic (expandable) systems for anything you could imagine (gamemodes, songs, mods for gamemodes)
- on the fly loaded assets 
    - tracked object models (swords, guns, gloves, shoes) 
    - avatars / player models
    - environments
    - targets
    - obstacles 
- loading of songs / beatmaps from other games (beat saber, audica, osu!, guitar hero (and clones), etc...)
