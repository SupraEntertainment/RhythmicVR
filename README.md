# VRRythmGame

The following list contains my plans for this Project:
- [ ] Modularity / support for multiple gamemodes (addable afterwards -> via assetbundles?)
	- [ ] Beat Saber inspired gamemode (Swords) with support for feet / hip tracker
	- [ ] DDR inspired gamemode (arrow pad on floor)
	- [ ] Audica inspired gamemode (with Guns)
	- [ ] kind of Guitar hero on the floor (for feet)

### Mechanics
- Song loading via json file (json specs furth down)
- dynamic (expandable) systems for anything you could imagine (gamemodes, songs, mods for gamemodes)
- on the fly loaded assets (swords, guns, avatars, environments, Notes, Walls...)
- loading of songs / beatmaps from other games (beat saber, audica, osu, ...)
