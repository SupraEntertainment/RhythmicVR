# VRRythmGame

The following list contains my plans for this Project:
- [ ] Modularity / support for multiple gamemodes (addable afterwards -> via assetbundles?)
	- [X] Beat Saber inspired gamemode (Hands, feet, hips / Swords)
	- [ ] DDR inspired gamemode (arrow pad on floor)
	- [ ] Audica inspired gamemode (with Guns)
	- [ ] kind of Guitar hero on the floor (for feet)

### Mechanics
- [X] Song loading via json file (json specs in code -> Song.cs & Beatmap.cs)
- [X] dynamic (expandable) systems for anything you could imagine (gamemodes, songs, mods for gamemodes)
- [ ] on the fly loaded assets
    - [ ] tracked object models (swords, guns, gloves, shoes)
    - [ ] avatars / player models
    - [ ] environments
    - [ ] targets
    - [ ] obstacles
- [ ] loading of songs / beatmaps from other games
	- [X] beat saber
	- [ ] audica
	- [ ] osu!
	- [ ] guitar hero (and clones)
	- [ ] etc...
